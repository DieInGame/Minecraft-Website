    <h2>The Apartment Building</h2>
    <p>Started by Shadowriver, construction on this multistory appartment building is now complete.  If you donated glass please choose an unclaimed floor and start customizing!  You may change the floor and the ceiling if you wish but may not touch the glass.  Send me pictures of your finished product.<a href="archives/projects/apartment-12-03-2010.png"><img src="archives/projects/apartment-12-03-2010.png" width="600" height="382" alt="Apartment Building" /></a><br />

    <h2>The Spawn Area</h2>
    <p>The spawn is the first view anyone has of the server and should make a great first impression.  Currently the spawn area is very bland and could use a comeplete overhaul.  If anyone feels up to the task of making a simple and elegant spawn area please pm Abadon125 about gaining access to editing it.<a href="archives/projects/spawn-11-24-2010.png"><img src="archives/projects/spawn-11-24-2010.png" width="600" height="480" alt="Apartment Building" /></a></p>
